# JavaStream
In this Mini-Project you will be solving problems using both non-functional and functional approaches.

Streams  

Iterating and manipulating collections using for loops and streams.

We've provided an Entry JavaBean with the following variables (representing a journal entry)

Day day (an enum provided in starter files)
String note
Create a dozen Entries in a list using a "populate method" (see starter file).

Using the collection of Entry objects provided, fill in the methods in the starter files. For each method, you will need to write regular non-functional programming code, and then a functional programming solution. The first function which prints out all of the entries is given to you as an example.

Extras  

Add an int variable named "duration". Set the value in the populate method to be between 0 and 100 (hint Random class nextInt(100) method.

In main write a method that

uses a for loop to print the entries with a duration greater than 10.
uses functional programming to do the same
In main write a method that

uses a for loop to find the highest duration.
uses functional programming to do the same
